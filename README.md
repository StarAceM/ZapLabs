Notes:

I stopped right about at the 2hr mark. I found myself fiddling with the xml layout and decided to stop. I know it doesn't match exactly but in the scope of the exercise this is how far I got. 

There are something I did here that I wouldn't normally do for the sake of time and the simplicity of the app itself. Naming conventions were simple because I knew given the scope that there wouldn't be many adpaters, recyclerviews, etc.

MVP: I used a MVP implementation of the Recylcer view but at the same time I know that it would have been better to have also used dependency injection to uncouple the classes from each other. 

Overall is was a good exercise and one that I am pretty comfortable with. Thanks for the opportunity and I look forward to meeting you sometime soon.
