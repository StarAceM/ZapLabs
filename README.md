Notes:

I stopped right about at the 2hr mark. I found myself fiddling with the xml layout and decided to stop. I know it doesn't exactly match but given the scope of the exercise this is how far I got. 

Given the scope of the app and the time frame, aspects of the app don't completely reflect how cleanly I like to code. Naming conventions were simple because I knew given the scope that there wouldn't be many adpaters, recyclerviews, etc. Also I would have put more thought into making the code more reusable. I tried to keep it as simple as possible and only commmited code once on the master branch, which I would of course never normally do. 

MVP: I used a MVP implementation of the Recylcer view but at the same time I know that it would have been better to have also used dependency injection to uncouple the classes from each other. 

Overall is was a good exercise and one that I am pretty comfortable with. Thanks for the opportunity and I look forward to meeting you sometime soon.
